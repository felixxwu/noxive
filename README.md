# Noxive.com

Noxive is my alias for my electronic music production hobby. So far I have gained over 500k views across YouTube, SoundCloud and Spotify, and generated a small income of $400 from royalties. I have had the opportunity to collaborate with many talented artists over the last few years, improving my communication and feedback skills.

This is a landing page for Noxive. It features links to my social media, discography, and a built-in music player. I advertise this site anywhere I can because it has proven to serve well as an entry point for anyone looking for a particular Noxive social media account or release.
